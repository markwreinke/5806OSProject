# 5806OSProject

This project was made for the Spring 2020 semester of CSCI 5806 Operating Class at Youngstown State University, under Dr. Bob Kramer.
 
This project was made by Mark Reinke and Chase Hovel.
 
The purpose of the program is to copy files back and forth from a host system and a VDI file. There are three commands:

 -tohost VDIFilePath srcFileInVDIPath destPath
      Retrieve a file from the given VDI file (VDIFilePath) by giving the absolute path name of the wanted file (srcFileInVDIPath)
      and the absolute path (including the desired file name) for the destination of the copied file (destPath).
 
 -tovdi VDIFilePath srcFilePath
      Insert a file into the given VDI file (VDIFilePath) by giving the absolute path name of the wanted file (srcFilePath).
 
 -display VDIFilePath
      Display the files within the given VDI file (VDIFilePath)
 
 
 Thank you for viewing our project, and we believe that, at the very least, your computer shouldn't catch fire upon its execution.
 (Though we pride ourselves of having done a better job than that :) )
